```

This vignette details why and how the `ons_mortality` dataset was created.

The data were pulled together from the weekly xls spreadsheets provided by the Office of National Statistics (ONS) from 2010 to 2019 for training purposes and is a static data set.  

Data is released every Friday and includes provisionally registered deaths for England and Wales for:

- Total, all deaths
- regions of usual residence
- age bands (persons and for males/females) 
- by underlying cause 'All respiratory diseases' (the methodology has changed over the years, see the subsection for more information)

### Further notes taken from the spreadsheet:

1 This average is based on the actual number of death registrations recorded for each corresponding week over the previous five years. Moveable public holidays, when register offices are closed, affect the number of registrations made in the published weeks and in the corresponding weeks in previous years.						
						
2 Counts of deaths by underlying cause exclude deaths at age under 28 days.						
						
3 Coding of deaths by underlying cause for the latest week is not yet complete.						
						
4 Does not include deaths where age is either missing or not yet fully coded. For this reason counts of 'Persons', 'Males' and 'Females' may not sum to 'Total Deaths, all ages'.						
						
5 Does not include deaths of those resident outside England and Wales or those records where the place of residence is either missing or not yet fully coded. For this reason counts for "Deaths by Region of usual residence" may not sum to "Total deaths, all ages".						
						

### Later confirmation of deaths					

Aggregate numbers of deaths are later confirmed and released in by [ONS monthly](https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/birthsdeathsandmarriages/deaths/datasets/monthlyfiguresondeathsregisteredbyareaofusualresidence). Numbers are released at a lower geographical level to the weekly data. 

## Preparation of data

In order to prepare this data for analysis the worksheet for weekly figures was extracted and the data was moved to long form and merged together over the available years. This was extracted in April 2020 when full previous years' data was available.

The dataset contains:

- __category_1:__ character, containing the names of the groups for counts, e.g. "Total deaths", "all ages".
- __category_2:__ character, subcategory of names of groups where necessary, e.g. details of region: "East", details of age bands "15-44".
- __counts:__ numeric, numbers of deaths in whole numbers and average numbers with decimal points. To retain the integrity of the format this column data is left as character.
- __date:__ date, format is yyyy-mm-dd; all dates are a Friday.
- __week_no:__ integer, each week in a year is numbered sequentially.

# Source and licence acknowledgement

This data has been made available through Office of National Statistics under the [Open Government
Licence](http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/doc/open-government-licence/version/3/).

## Creating the dataset

Spreadsheets are in xls format from 2010 to 2019.

Each week is released with a new file name listing the week number and all weeks for that year are included in the spreadsheet. Counts for weeks ahead are missing and listed as NA. 

When a year has passed it is renamed to the year name and does not change.

## Extracting worksheets to csv

The data can be found in the worksheet called Weekly figures "date/year". Other worksheets in spreadsheets 2010 to 2019 are:

- Contents
- Information
- Terms and conditions
- Weekly figures <year>
- Related publications

The following code finds the tab name and then creates a csv file for each tab/worksheet.

```{r extracting worksheets}

library(readxl)
library(dplyr)

files_list <- list.files(path = "working_files",
                         pattern = "*.xls",
                         full.names = TRUE)


read_then_csv <- function(sheet, path) {
  pathbase <- path %>%
    basename() %>%
    tools::file_path_sans_ext()
  path %>%
    read_excel(sheet = sheet) %>%
    write_csv(paste0(pathbase, "-", sheet, ".csv"))
}


for(j in 1:length(files_list)){

  path <- paste0(files_list[j])

  path %>%
    excel_sheets() %>%
    set_names() %>%
    map(read_then_csv, path = path)
}

```



## Loading the weekly figure worksheets

From 2010 to 2015 the tab name was Weekly Figures then it changed capitalisation to Weekly figures.

```{r load_files}

files_list_sheets <- list.files(path = "working_files",
                         pattern = "Weekly",
                         full.names = TRUE
                         )

for(i in files_list_sheets) {

  x <- read_csv((i), col_types = cols(.default = col_character()))

  assign(i, x)
}

```

## Format data functions

Two functions were required to format the spreadsheets as there were changes to the layout from 2016.

Packages used: 

- __janitor:__ a specific package for cleaning data from Excel used here to remove the blank lines and columns, convert Excel serial numbers to dates and to format all column headers by removing spaces in those header names and removing capitalisation.
- __tidyverse:__ specifically dplyr for data manipulation. 
- __stringi:__ a package to works with strings and was used to find certain characters or words.
- __lubridate:__ a package to work with dates and used here to format dates to the same format.

### 2010 - 2015

```{r format function 2010 to 2015}

Notes from the spreadsheets in relation to these methodology changes:

### 2011 

* Respiratory deaths for 2011 are coded to the new version of ICD-10 while for 2010 they are coded to the previous version. Week 1 2011 has been coded to both versions to give an indication of the impact of the change.						
					
### 2014

* For deaths registered from January 2014, cause of death is coded to the ICD-10 classification using IRIS software. Further information about the implementation of the software is available on the ONS website. 						

* All deaths registered in week 2 were dual-coded using both ICD-10 v2010 (NCHS) and ICD-10 v2013 (IRIS). An information note providing the preliminary findings on the impact of the implementation of IRIS software for ICD-10 cause of death coding on mortality statistics in England and Wales is available on the ONS website.						

### 2015

* For deaths registered from January 2014, cause of death is coded to the ICD-10 classification using IRIS software. Further information about the [implementation of the software](https://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20160106020045/http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/guide-method/user-guidance/health-and-life-events/Changes-to-cause-of-death-coding-in-England-and-Wales/index.html) is available on the ONS website.						
					
## Age bands

Numbers are provided for categories: Persons, Females and Males. 

As detailed in the notes, if the age is missing or not coded at the time of release then the counts of 'Persons', 'Males' and 'Females' may not sum to 'Total Deaths, all ages'.						

Note that these age bands were changed in 2020 releases.

```{r age bands}

ons_mortality %>% 
  select(category_1, category_2) %>% 
  group_by(category_1, category_2) %>% 
  filter(category_1 %in% c('Persons','Females','Males')) %>% 
  slice(1)

```
