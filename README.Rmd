## Datasources for reuse

This package has been created to help NHS, Public Health and related analysts/data scientists learn to use `R`. It contains several free datasets (just one at the moment), help files explaining their structure, and `vignette` examples of their use.  We encourage contributions to the package, both to expand the set of training material, but also as development for newer `R`/github users as a first contribution.  Please add relevant free, open source data sets that you think may benefit the NHS R-community.

## Installation instructions

This packages is not yet submitted to CRAN, but can be installed from source, via this Github repository.
You will need `Rtools` (https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/Rtools/) installed to build the package, and the `remotes` package.

```{r install, eval=FALSE}
remotes::install_github("https://github.com/nhs-r-community/NHSRdatasets")
```
