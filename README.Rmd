## Data sources for reuse

This package has been created to help NHS, Public Health and related analysts/data scientists learn to use `R`. 
It contains several free datasets with help files explaining their structure, and `vignette` examples of their use.  

We encourage contributions to the package, both to expand the set of training material, and also as development for newer `R`/github users as a first or early contribution.  
Please add relevant free, open source data sets that you think may benefit the NHS-R Community.
