Information on monthly deaths
NA
Things you need to know
NA
"Monthly death figures provide counts of the number of deaths registered in a calendar month, by area of usual residence in England and Wales for 2019."
NA
"These figures are presented by regions (within England), unitary authorities, counties, districts and London boroughs."
NA
"Since August 2018, figures for the latest month are based on data available up to the 19th of the following month. Previously the figures were extracted on the third Thursday of the following month. This change has a negligible impact on our statistics."
NA
Notes
NA
Deaths occurring in England and Wales are registered on the General Register Office's Registration Online (RON) system.
Daily extracts of death registration records from RON are processed on our database systems.
NA
Figures remain provisional until final annual data are released.
"Due to the timeliness of this release, death registrations may be included in this publication before they are fully coded with area information. The order in which area of usual residence information is coded can affect the additivity within this publication. When provisional figures are collated:"
– A very small number of death registrations can sometimes have region of usual residence coded but no local area coding. Consequently counts for local areas may not always sum to the regional count.
"– A very small number of death registrations can sometimes have some area information coded but may still require the country of usual residence code. If necessary, country counts are derived from regional counts to ensure they are representative."
NA
"Limitations of the monthly deaths data:
Monthly deaths figures are published to meet user needs, providing very timely, but provisional counts of death registrations in England and Wales and by local authority of usual residence. At this time, registrations extracted from our deaths database have not been subject to the full quality assurance process. Consequently, any quarterly or annual figures calculated from the monthly deaths figures should only be considered as provisional."
NA
"An annual death registrations dataset for 2019 will be extracted from the ONS deaths database in 2020 and will form the basis for ONS's annual death registration figures. This annual dataset will be subject to a full quality assurance process before final figures are published. We expect to publish final annual data on 2019 death registrations in July 2020. At this time, monthly death registrations for 2019 will be updated using the annual dataset to ensure consistency with annual figures."
NA
Weekly deaths counts cannot be summed to match the counts for monthly deaths as some weeks may span more than 1 month.
NA
Bank Holidays could affect the number of registrations made within those months.
NA
Figures for the latest month are based on boundaries as of November 2019.
