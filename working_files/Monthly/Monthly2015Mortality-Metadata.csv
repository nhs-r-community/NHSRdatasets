Introduction
NA
"Monthly death figures provide counts of the number of deaths registered in a calendar month, by area of usual residence in England and Wales for 2015."
NA
"These figures are presented by regions (within England), unitary authorities, counties, districts & London boroughs."
NA
Notes
NA
Deaths occurring in England and Wales are registered on the General Register Office's Registration Online (RON) system.
Daily extracts of death registration records from RON are processed on our database systems.

The number of deaths registered in 2015 by month in England and Wales have now been finalised. There are only small changes from the provisional figures released during the year.
"Due to the timeliness of this release, death registrations may be included in this publication before they are fully coded with area information. The order in which area of usual residence information is coded can affect the additivity within this publication. When provisional figures are collated:"
- A very small number of death registrations can sometimes have region of usual residence coded but no local area coding. Consequently counts for local areas may not always sum to the regional count.
"- A very small number of death registrations can sometimes have some area information coded but may still require the country of usual residence code. If necessary, country counts are derived from regional counts to ensure they are representative."
NA
Weekly deaths counts cannot be summed to match the counts for monthly deaths as some weeks may span more than one month.
NA
Bank Holidays could affect the number of registrations made within those months.
