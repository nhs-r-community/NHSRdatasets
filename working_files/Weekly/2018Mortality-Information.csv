Notes and definitions

Deaths occurring in England and Wales are registered on the General Register Office's Registration Online system (RON).
NA
Daily extracts of death registration records from RON are processed on our database systems.
NA
Provisional data on deaths registered in each week (ending on a Friday) are compiled at the end of the following week.
NA
Bank Holidays could affect the number of registrations made within those weeks.
NA
The respiratory diseases counts are updated with each weekly publication as the coding of the underlying cause is not always complete at the time of production.

"In January 2014, ONS changed the software used to code cause of death. Further information about the implementation of the software can be found on our website."
NA
"Where there are the same values in categories in consecutive weeks, the counts have been checked and are made up of unique death registrations."

Figures for the latest week are based on boundaries as of November 2018.
