## Data sources for reuse

This package has been created to help NHS, Public Health and related
analysts/data scientists learn to use `R`. It contains several free
datasets, with help files, explaining their structure, and includes
`vignette` examples of their use.

We encourage contributions to the package, both to expand the set of
training material, and also as development for newer `R`/github users as
a first or early contribution.  
Please add relevant free, open source data sets that you think may
benefit the NHS-R Community.

## Installation instructions

You can install the package from [CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org)
with:

``` r
install.packages("NHSRdatasets")
```

To install the development version from [GitHub](https://github.com/)
with:

``` r
# install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("nhs-r-community/NHSRdatasets")
```

## Datasets available
