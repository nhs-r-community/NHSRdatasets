## This package is a work in progress, and may change or be withdrawn

## Datasources for reuse

This package has been created to help NHS, Public Health and related
analysts/data scientists learn to use `R`. It contains several free
datasets (just one at the moment), help files explaining their
structure, and `vignette` examples of their use. We encourage
contributions to the package, both to expand the set of training
material, but also as development for newer `R`/github users as a first
contribution. Please add relevant free, open source data sets that you
think may benefit the NHS R-community.

## Installation instructions

This packages is not yet submitted to CRAN, but can be installed from

the package, and the `remotes`
