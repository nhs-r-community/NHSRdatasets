Introduction
NA
"Weekly death figures provide provisional counts of the number of deaths registered in England and Wales for which data are available, and the number of deaths for which the underlying cause was coded to respiratory diseases as defined in the International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems Tenth Revision (ICD-10)."
NA
"These figures are also presented by age group, sex and by area of usual residence."
NA
Notes and definitions
NA
Deaths occurring in England and Wales are registered on the General Register Office's Registration Online system (RON).
NA
Daily extracts of death registration records from RON are processed on ONS' database systems.
NA
Provisional data on deaths registered in each week (ending on a Friday) are compiled at the end of the following week.
NA
Bank Holidays could affect the number of registrations made within those weeks.
NA
The respiratory diseases counts are updated with each weekly publication as the coding of the underlying cause is not always complete at the time of production.
NA
The 10th revision of the International Statistical Classification of Diseases (ICD-10) was introduced in England and Wales in January 2001. Since then updates to the classification have been authorised by the World Health Organisation and are in use in other countries.
NA
"Where there are the same values in categories in consecutive weeks, the counts have been checked and are made up of unique death registrations."
